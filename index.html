            <p>Spirit island, located in the heart of Maligne Lake, Jasper was a spiritual place of healing for the rocky mountain tribe for over 2000 years before they were displaced in the 1900s. They believed that each mountain with a face in the hall of the gods (the mountains in front of spirit island) contains the essence of each god of each religion as well as all notable rocky mountain tribesmen.</p>
            
            <p>In 2020, there was a forest fire in a nearby forest region of Lake Maligne. Because of that forest fire, the few remaining tribe members from that same rocky mountain tribe approached the Canadian government to get access to Spirit Island away since they believe that the forest fire was a punishment by their gods for being away from their spiritual home for so long. Now, the rocky mountain tribe works with the Canadian government to perform their spiritual healing once a year.</p>

The bay is famous for its crystal clear emerald colored waters dotted with limestone mountains that rise up from the water.

For instance, tourists can take kayak expeditions around the Teapot islets, a set of islands shaped like teapots, or be rowed around Stone Dog, which appears to be shaped like a dog.</p>
            
            <p>The Ha Long Bay region is popular for scuba diving, rock climbing and hiking, particularly in mountainous Cát Bà National Park. The nearest city is Hai Phong, which is approximately 75 km away. It is easier to reach Ha Long Bay by boat because the journey from Hai Phong to Ha Long Bay can take nearly 2.5 hours.</p>
