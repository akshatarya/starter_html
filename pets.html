                trusty, dog (bichon). She gets princess treatment in her household, but also out in public. 
                As a consequence, she is very clingy and loves to lick, especially in the face.</p>
        
            <p>She endeavors in multiple hobbies and activities, which include flying, licking, 
                standing on two legs, ringing bells, and jumping through hula hoops.</p>

            src="Images/cookysmiley.jpg" 
            alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling">
            <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around,
                go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets
                and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with 
                his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my 
                dad, or cooling off in the garage.
            </p>

            <p>He's still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone
            rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing
            towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he's hyper 
            and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill
            and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn
                Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He's a very old boy who 
                likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is
                super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and 
                will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.
            </p>
            
            <p> Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it 
                when other dogs steal attention from him and he will 
                lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with 
                another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker
                with the poodle when it was being loud.</p>

            <p>Cooper is an 8-year-old border collie and lab mix. We rescued him from the Humane Society as a puppy!
                He loves going on long walks/runs, but he stops to sniff something every few steps. He's pretty friendly,
                but he loves to loudly bark at delivery people who ring the doorbell.</p>

            <p>Whenever it's movie night, Cooper has to join on the couch/bed or he feels left out. He loves
                to cuddle and pats on his tummy. Cooper will play fetch for about 2 or 3 rounds, but he
                quickly gets bored. He leaves his toys all around the house for the rest of the family to find.</p>
